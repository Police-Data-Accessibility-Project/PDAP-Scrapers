This readme should give people everything they need to maintain the scraper.

# Summary
Added to dataset. Agency ID: 77defdbce68c4bcd9a0663a1857e65f9

This scraper is **NOT** a list_pdf scraper, instead it uses `Selenium`. **DO NOT** attempt to update to use `bs_common` or `list_pdf_scrapers`, as this uses a custom Selenium variant of the base scripts.

You will have to set `executable_path` to wherever your selenium is installed to.

# How to locate the data source
Navigate to [home page](http://beaumontpd.org/)
Crime>Crime Statistics
Each year (except 2018, dead link) leads to a separate index. The scraper first scrapes this page, gets the yearly links, and then opens those to scrape the pdf links, before downloading them.

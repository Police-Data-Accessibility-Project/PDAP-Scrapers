This selection of tools helps interface with CKAN instances. The first tool "package_list" (AKA "PDAP Tucan") gets a list of all available data packages hosted at a CKAN instance by having a user provide a core URL.

Future:

- Download selected packages
- Upload packages to a CKAN instance via API
- Other tools as necessary
